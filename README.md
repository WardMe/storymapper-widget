# Storymapper a Figjam Widget

## Development guide

*This widget is built with [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/).*

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) – v14
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)

### Build the widget

To watch for code changes and rebuild the widget automatically:

```
$ npm run watch
```

### Install the widget

2. Search for and run `Import widget from manifest…` via the Quick Actions search bar.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file that was generated by the `build` script.

### Debugging
